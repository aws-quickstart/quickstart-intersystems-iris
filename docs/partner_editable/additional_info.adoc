Establish connection to IRIS Node01 via Bastion Host

[source,bash]
----
$ chmod 400 <my-ec2-key>.pem
$ ssh-add <my-ec2-key>.pem
$ ssh -J ec2-user@<bastion-public-ip> ec2-user@<node01-private-ip> -L 52773:<node01-private-ip>:52773
----

The IRIS Management Portal for the instance should be available at: http://localhost:52773/csp/sys/%25CSP.Portal.Home.zen Credentials - User: SuperUser, and the password you entered at stack creation.

Navigate to _System Administration | Configuration | Mirror Settings | Edit Mirror_. Make sure the system is configured with two Failover members.

Verify that the mirrored database is created and active. _System Administration | Configuration | Local Databases_.

Validate the JDBC connection by following the https://docs.intersystems.com/irislatest/csp/docbook/DocBook.UI.Page.cls?KEY=AFL\_jdbc[First Look JDBC document] to validate JDBC connectivity to IRIS via the Load Balancer. Make sure to change the url variable to the value displayed in the template output, and password from 'SYS' to the one you selected during setup.

=== Failover Test

On the Node02, navigate to the Management Portal (see &quot;Health Check&quot; section above) and open the Configuration-\&gt;Edit Mirror page. At the bottom of the page you will see _This member is the backup. Changes must be made on the primary._

Locate the Node01 instance in the AWS EC2 management dashboard. Its name will be of the format: MyStackName-Node01-1NGXXXXXX

Restart the Node01 instance. This will simulate an instance/AZ outage.

Reload Node02 'Edit Mirror' page. The status should change to: _This member is the primary. Changes will be sent to other members._
